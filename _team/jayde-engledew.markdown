A self-starter in the music industry, Jayde got her foot in the door by starting her own music blog; writing reviews, attending shows, and interviewing a handful of musicians. She then continued professionally in PR at Republic Media, going on to spend two years at Music Glue, and joined Listen Up in 2018 as the Office Assistant. Jayde is an advocate for mental health as well as the LGBTQ community, and works closely with the HR and Operations team to ensure all employees at Listen Up are happy.
