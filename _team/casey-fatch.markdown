Casey’s introduction to the music industry began on site working in artist liaison at numerous music festivals. His good work ethic and passion for hospitality allowed him to quickly climb the ranks within the artist relations department where he eventually began managing backstage hospitality for music festivals in the Pacific Northwest.  After 3 years serving as Hospitality Manager for USC Events, he was given the chance to move back home to Los Angeles and began working at Deckstar Artists Management as a day-to-day manager and manager’s assistant.  Now with 7+ years of experience within the industry, Casey joins us as Press Manager with the North American team.
