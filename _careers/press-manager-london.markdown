about-description: Established in 2009 Listen Up offer a tailored range of bespoke
  radio, club, stream-ing, online and print promotion campaigns globally through our
  LA and London offices. In 2014 after recognising a gap in the market we moved our
  services state-side and opened an additional arm of the business in LA. Working
  across a wide range of genres including electronic, hip hop, r&b, pop and alternative,
  we place our clients directly in the spotlight with the experience and knowhow to
  oversee thoughtful, effective and engaging campaigns. With a client roster boasting
  the likes of Doja Cat, MK, Black Coffee, Becky Hill, Ivorian Doll, The Martinez
  Brothers, Jamie Jones and more, Listen Up are now recognised as one of the market
  leaders in the world of music promotion services. We have grown massively over the
  last 10 years with offices in both the UK and US, and 3 companies working under
  our Listen Up umbrella
