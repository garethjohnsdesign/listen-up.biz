about-description: Established in 2009 Listen Up offer a tailored range of bespoke
  radio, club, streaming, online and print promotion campaigns globally through our
  LA and London offices. In 2014 after recognising a gap in the market we moved our
  services stateside and opened an additional arm of the business in LA. Specialising
  in electronic music and events, we place our clients directly in the spotlight with
  the experience and knowhow to oversee thoughtful, effective and engaging campaigns.
  With a client roster boasting the likes of MK, Snakehips, Doja Cat, Jonas Blue,
  Gorgon City, Black Coffee, Tiesto, Marshmello, and Samm Henshaw, Listen Up are now
  recognised as one of the market leaders in the world of music promotion services.
  We have grown massively over the last 10 years with offices in both the UK and US,
  and 3 companies working under our Listen Up umbrella.
