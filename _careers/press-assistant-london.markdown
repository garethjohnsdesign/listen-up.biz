about-description: Established in 2009 Listen Up offer a tailored range of bespoke
  radio, club, streaming, online and print promotion campaigns globally through our
  LA and London offices. In 2014 after recognising a gap in the market we moved our
  services stateside and opened an addi-tional arm of the business in LA. Specialising
  in electronic music and events, we place our clients directly in the spotlight with
  the experience and knowhow to oversee thoughtful, ef-fective and engaging campaigns.
  With a client roster boasting the likes of Doja Cat, MK, Black Coffee, Burna Boy,
  Ivorian Doll, The Martinez Brothers, Jamie Jones and more, Listen Up are now recognised
  as one of the market leaders in the world of music promotion ser-vices. We have
  grown massively over the last 10 years with offices in both the UK and US, and 3
  companies working under our Listen Up umbrella.
