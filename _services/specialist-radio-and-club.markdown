#### Rest of World Specialist Radio

Our specialist radio and club department operates from our UK office, working closely with all specialist radio presenters and producers across the globe. We have daily meetings across all stations and aim to gain exposure for your project on a global level. We work out strategic timelines for radio with targeted roll out plans, looking to confirm high level single and remix premieres.

#### US Mix Show + Dance Radio

Similarly to our rest of world specialist radio service, we have great working relationships with all key mix show and dance radio panel presenters and producers which are handled by our team from our LA office. We secure mix show plays and support at these stations with a view to playlist rotation adds, booking in key radio promotion to support tours, events and releases.

#### Club

Using our substantial relationships with A-List globally touring DJs, we service these tastemakers to gain personal reactions and chart support, allowing the label or artist to encourage DSPs to support with profile on their stores. We aim for the highest possible chart positions with both Cool Cuts and Buzz Chart as part of this service.
